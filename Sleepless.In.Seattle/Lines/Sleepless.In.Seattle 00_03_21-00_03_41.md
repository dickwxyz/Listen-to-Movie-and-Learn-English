Greg‘s wife:
>Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women. You'll meet someone.

Sam:

>Right, right. Move on. Right, that's, that’s what I'm gonna do.
>
And then, in a few months, boom, I’ll be fine.

> I'll just grow a new heart.

Greg‘s wife:

>Sam, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.


Sam:
>I know, I know. Look, it just doesn’t happen twice.

It just doesn’t happen twice. 不会再爱了。
